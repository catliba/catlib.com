## I need a Jet 2 holiday
Happy Thanksgiving week. I hope all you working mfers can enjoy some time off these holidays. I certainly will. These days have been going by real fast. I remember my friends left for Korea a month ago (I think they went to the South one and not the North one), and now they're back. I didn't go with them but I lowkey wish I said yes. It barely felt like they left.  
A few months ago, when I went to China, a month there felt like half a year, but at home, a month feels barely like a week. Unreal. Time moves scary fast. 

## Day 131 of Challenge: Nobody gives a fuck
The same old stuff happens each week, and I feel like nothing changes and nothing interesting is going on in my life. Is this the postgrad life? Maybe I'm getting too comfortable. With the conclusion of undergrad, meeting people and talking to anyone face-to-face is rare. I kinda miss it.

I've deleted all social media from my phone. It is an illness in my brain. The average intelligence of a person on social media is most likely lower than the average intelligence of the people around you -- read the comment section and tell me otherwise. If you spend too much time on there, you'll probably be influenced by them for better or worse (usually worse). Unfortunately, I am a recovering victim. Social media has unapologetically reentered my life for the past few months. It makes me waste time and energy, takes me down random, pointless rabbit holes, and plants unnecessary fear that is bad for my mental state.   
For instance, I see too many clips of how bad the job market is and other related discouraging information. I know many say that it's "cooked" with some degree of truth. But should we just give up on everything?  
Another example is seeing people share their winning bets, hands, or trades. More often than not, they only share victories and hide their losses. This disillusions people into thinking that these pathways are easy money. News flash: they're not! People love flexing on social media because it attracts attention -- no one likes showing off misfortune. Of course, some real folks on the app show the whole picture. Those guys I'll miss seeing.  
Overall, following social media makes you follow the herd. You start thinking like everyone else, and then you lose individuality and possibly even opporitunities. 

## To be continued...
Obviously, social media ain't all bad. You can learn and become exposed to a lot of good on social media. I see an argument for how many things you see online can inspire or motivate. I think discernment is key. Knowing what's good and what's not when you consume content online can keep you from going off the deep end. As someone who gets easily influenced by others, I think deleting everything and going cold turkey is best for me. Thanks for tuning in this week. See you offline, hopefully.

## Conclusion
When am i getting this fixed?
