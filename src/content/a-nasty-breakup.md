## I Eat Human
You are what you eat. That is why I am human. That was a joke an old friend used to repeat that really annoyed me, hence why I still remember it to this day. But I bring up that stupid joke because how you spend your time is how you'll turn out later on in life. This is obvious in retrospect, but in my everyday life, I tend not to think too hard about how I spend my time. That may be why I'm so cracked at Clash Royale.

## An application a day keeps unemployment at bay
I remember in college, I was really consistent with going to the gym. My day was categorized as "before gym" and "after gym." Clearly, it was the highlight of my day. I didn't see it as a chore. In fact, I actually looked forward to going every day, and that's probably why I was able to persist for years.  
Recently, I've been doing technical interview practice problems every day, and I kinda feel a similar way with it (screw testing edge cases though). Like the gym, I don't spend the whole day doing it. Just a few hours a day, but over time, I can see a difference. Hopefully, I can do better in technical interviews now. Once I get an interview, that is.

## WTF CALEB WHY ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT POEKR AGAIN?!
Of course, these strips always gotta circle back to poker. Granted, poker was the main reason why catlieb.com died in the first place a few years ago. Who tf wants to read about poker every week?

## I wanted more
Recently, I've been shot-taking, and it hasn't gone well. Shot-taking in poker is playing at larger stakes than you normally play. The point of shot-taking is to be able to play those larger stakes more comfortably to the point where those larger stakes become the new normal. Think of it as leveling up or moving onto the next level. For me, that's playing 1/2 online and 5/5 live (online usually plays smaller than live), and I've lost upwards of $3,000 in the last few weeks. 3k is not much relative to the stakes I was playing at, but it is still a lot of money. I would be lying if I said it didn't make me sad, or mad, or disillusioned. I guess I can be described as "tilted."

## How I love her
I play poker for the love of the game, not as a means of making money, and I hold that to be true to this day. It’s pretty evident if you know what stakes I play (who tf grinds low stakes for money?). I've been playing low stakes for my entire poker career even though I know my bankroll allows for me to play higher. Yet, I never bothered because I was pretty content just playing and understanding the game and all its complexion. It wasn't making money that drew me into the game. It was the game itself (and I guess winning lol). 

## She broke my heart
So why do I shot-take if I say that I don't play for the money? I don't know. Maybe playing at the same level for months on end gets boring, and I wanted to test the waters with bigger boys. Maybe I was winning consistently enough for me to move up and prove myself at higher stakes. Maybe at some point in time, it became more about the money than the game. Drop the maybe. These are all reasons why I decided to shot-take. 

In chess, the equivalent of this would be if you cared more about getting elo than getting better at the game itself. Getting elo does mean that you're getting better, but the priority is kinda backwards. I guess I just wanted to prove to myself that I got better at the game without actually actively trying to get better.  

However, when I shot-take, I lose sight of the game itself. All the reasons that made me love No Limit Texas Hold'em are now replaced by anxiousness and fear. My thoughts become clouded, and poker becomes a termite in my brain, infecting my mental well-being and sanity. Throw strategy, discipline, and everything that I earned out the window! After every unsuccessful shot-take, I begin to lose my love for the game. This most recent shot-take made me ponder whether playing hours of poker every day is the best use of my time and my life. Spoiler alert: its not. In fact, this recent shot-take actually made me give up altogether. 

## I’ve moved on
I've made peace with the game. Nowadays, I am rediscovering my love for the game and why I play it. Like with chess, I find myself coming back to it. However, I see the game less as something less serious and something more casual, kinda like how I treat chess now. I guess you can call me a recreational player, but I still enjoy studying the theory behind the game. 

I seriously despised clicking buttons for hours on end back then, only to end the night down hundreds. As I stated in the beginning, you are what you eat, but I might be taking too big of a bite by wanting to become a professional player. Time is the only limiting factor preventing me, but time is also scarce. Such a valuable thing that I do not want to throw away. Time is of the essence, and that essence can be better spent elsewhere. Poker is still a part of my life, and it probably always will be, but, like with the gym, I’ve moved on from its obsession. See you off the felt!

## Conclusion
FUCKKKKKK
