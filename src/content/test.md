## Hello World
Welcome to the first strip of catlieb.com!!! Whether you're my friend or you just somehow stumbled across this website, I am very glad that you are here taking time to read my strips. In this strip, I would like to share the inspiration and process of creating catlieb.com. I used to write down life moments and epiphanies on my iOS's Notes app. But Notes is now a thing of a past, and all I can say to that experience is: "good riddance." Now, not only can I write on a computer, but I can also share it to the world! Wow, very cool. 

## Tech Stack
I'll go more detail later on, but for now, I will briefly share what I used to make this website. With create-react-app dead, I had to look for alternative options for my build and development process. I settled with Vite. Writing in Typescript was also a first, and I love it. Saves me from a lot of headaches. Also, I'm using Strapi as a CMS and GraphQL API to fetch that data and serve my frontend. I store my data in a Postgresql cluster on Digital Ocean and deploy my backend on there.

## catlieb.com's Inspiration
So why did I make this website in the first place? As catlib.com is nearing its deployment, I begin to think more about my eagerness to make this personal website in the first place because I know very well that I would not have had the motivation to make this a summer ago.\
I believe the idea started when a good friend of mine (Ray) made a website over winter break with the intention of shitposting. I remember sitting next to him at Geisel Library's dimly lit basement tunnels and watching make his website come to life. Seeing his finished product, I was genuinely impressed. However, at that point of time, I did not see the hassle in making such a website for the sake of posting random stuff. That was around winter quarter 2022. Spring quarter came, and that quarter, I joined Theta Tau, which essentially is basically a group of smart and fun engineers. Being with them, I begin to realize how everyone is cracked there, and I begin to more seriously consider my own future. Theta Tau also forced me and my pledge bros to create a mobile app. I won't go into the details of the app (maybe one day if I'm bored), but after pulling several all nighters with my friend Yoza as the procrastinators we are, I felt the desire to create something of my own. \
During that spring quarter, I began to journal on Notes, writing down my experiences and mindset. In addition, I also enjoyed reading Ray's shitposts. While it is written in Chinese, the Google Translate version gets his points across. Thus, with how terrible of a journaling app Notes is and many motivating factors, the inception of catlib.com started this summer. 

## Escaping tutorial hell
I have some years of experience with JavaScript, HTML, CSS. I remember making a broken website game during 2018 for the Congressional App Challenge with the help of Khan Academy. I had no idea what I was doing, and my finished product really displays that (please don't check my github). However, while I might've further played around with web dev the following years after, I was stuck in tutorial hell, only doing tutorials and nothing else. It wasn't until this summer, after spending those nights with Yoza, did I realize that I can do things on my own. Shocker, I know. Granted, I followed yet another tutorial this summer trying to familiarize myself with the MERN stack. Essentially, while tutorials are a great way to learn about how something works, it made me afraid of doing things on my own. It's important to just have an idea and go for it, step by step.

## Roadblocks?
Undeniably, the hardest and most time consuming thing about catlib.com was the CSS (which is the styling in a website).  CSS is sorta like drawing. I can draw unimpressive stick figures all my life. It can have a cool story (HTML) or even cool animations (JavaScript). But my drawings remain stick figures. Learning CSS is kind of like learning how to draw. Unfortunately for me, having followed tutorials all my life, I just blindly copied their CSS. I basically had to learn CSS from scratch, and it was kind of tough not going to lie. There is just a lot going on. 

## Design
If it isn't CSS, the second most time consuming thing about catlib.com was coming up with a good design-something that I'm satisfied with. After nights of thought, I had a great idea of making it comic/cartoon themed in honor of my childhood nostalgia. Growing up, I read a lot of comic books, and a special one for me is Peanuts. Other personal favorites were Big Nate, Calvin and Hobbes, and Foxtrot. 

## Deployment
I'm writing this two days later after deploying my backend and boy was it rough. I was trying to deploy it through so many ways and couldn't settle on the best one. Alas, I decided to host my Postgresql backend on Digital Ocean. I didn't want to delve so deep with DevOps and wanted an easy and quick deploy process. With little backend/server experience, simple errors that occur are so foreign to me, and leave me stuck for a few hours. One day, I will learn DevOps (because I'm genuinely interested) and improve how my site is hosted. But as of right now, I'm on a free trial. It ain't cheap.

## Conclusion
Welp. That's it for this strip. I know how exciting "HTML, CSS, Javascript" and "Deployment" is, but I won't blame you if you skipped through those parts. \
Also, the reason why the domain is catlieb.com and not catlib.com is because the domain name for catlib.com costs $4000+. One day I'll buy it, but for now, catlieb will do. I also intend on adding a comment feature. As for my posting frequency, I'm aiming for once a week, but if the urge to share something ever surfaces, I will just post without caring too much about staying on a set schedule. Thanks for reading, and I hope to see you again.
