## My First Review, broh.
Earlier this year, a new season of *Rick and Morty* came out, Season 8, so I decided to rewatch the entire show again, starting from Season 1. I guess this strip is just about my takeaways and thoughts about this show.

## Quick Summary, broh.
For those who have never watched *Rick and Morty* and have no idea what it is about, it is an unserious show about a mad scientist, Rick, who built a portal gun, allowing him to travel to infinite dimensions across all universes. His sidekick is Morty, an average high school boy, who goes on these adventures with Rick. Rick lives with his daughter Beth, who is married to Jerry, a normal, little-too-lame, husband. Season 1 Episode 1 (S1E1) gives pretty good introductions of each character and the dynamics between them as well as a good pilot episode for what the show is about. However, I will inform you that although S1E1 might be boring (that's what I thought on the rewatch-a solid 4/10), give the show a chance, as the better episodes are later.

## Catlib’s Mind Blowers broh.
I feel like I have short-term memory loss each time I watch an episode, as I forget it within the hour. I believe this is because each episode is very unique and does not build on the previous one; the good episodes stick, and the bad ones get forgotten.

## Broh, Inter-cable Movies.
A lot of *Rick and Morty* episodes feel like twisted spinoffs of famous movies in today's pop culture. For instance, S1E2 is like *Inception*; Rick and Morty go inside the dream of a dream of a dream of a dream. S1E3 is like if *Jurassic Park* and *The Magic School Bus* had a baby. S3E4 is hilarious as we see Rick mock the corny Vindicators (the Avengers) by *"Saw"*-ing them. I’ve never watched *The Matrix*, but in S8E1, Morty and Summer get trapped in a Matrix-like simulation that Rick built as punishment for stealing his phone charger. Inside Rick’s custom reality, they live crazy, bizzare lives — going to prison, fighting in the Middle East, or becoming CEO. Once Rick finally pulls them out, they go back to live their normal high school lives, but they keep the memories from within the simulated reality. S6E4 is like the show *Severance*, but at night, if you’ve ever watched that. S8E7 is loosely similar to *Wreck-It Ralph* as Rick and Morty get stuck in a movie-making machine. There's more like this, but these episodes are a fun watch.

## Existential Satire broh.
*"Isn't comedy just the revelation of an unacknowledged truth?" (S8E1).*

Probably one of the best parts of *Rick and Morty* is how humor is employed through the dialogue of Rick and his nihilistic views on life. Rick understands everything. The science behind life’s existence, the futility of morality, and the endless repetition of the infinite universes. As the smartest man in the universe, being smart makes you more depressed. The more you understand how meaningless everything is, the harder it becomes to care. The contrapositive of that statement would be that the happier you are, the dumber you must be. I agree with Rick; ignorance is bliss. His punchlines are dark and an undercut to how nothing in the world really matters. 

Here are some of my favorite quotes I handpicked myself during the second watch through: 
- "It's not slavery. They'll work for each other and pay each other money." (S2E6)
- Minecraft: "So you’re mining stuff to craft with and crafting stuff to mine with. Did your dad write this game?" (S3E10).
- "It was pretty Rick of you to avert an apocalypse in a tantrum of cynicism just to destroy one dumb relationship." (S5E3).
- "I gotta respect these dinosaurs. They dominated a whole species just by calling its bluff about wanting more free time" (S6E6).


## Mr. PoopyButthole, broh.
Rick and Morty is more of a show you watch to unwind, to turn off your brain, and see where the show takes you. That’s part of what makes it so fun. It can be about anything, explore any topic, and end up in any way. For the most part, they don't follow a consistent narrative besides “going on an adventure,” but that can mean anything. 

Of course, many episodes fall flat or are super boring. Some notably bad ones are S1E8 or S4E6 or S7E8, or S8E2. They're essentially just Rick and Morty going on an adventure, getting up in some weird alien people's business, and then saving the world. To end, if you give this show a shot, let me know. The next slide will include my favorite episodes, my opinion wholly.
