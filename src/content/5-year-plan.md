## Life Downswing
I recently got rejected after making it to the final round for a SWE position at a company that I was eager to work at. The interview process itself took one month and mentally drained me, and now I am back at square one. Demoralizing, yes, but I took about a week or two off, not working on interview preparation material or applying or anything. However, I would be cheating myself if I were to continue on living like this. So, I guess I'm getting back into things now. 

## Kinda lost
Following that rejection, I needed to redefine my life goals. I need to wake up every day with a plan and purpose. To work towards something, otherwise I would be aimlessly working for what? But what is what? 

## 2021-2025 5-year plan
I created a 5 year plan 5-6 years ago (during Summer of 2020) and this is what it was (just copy pasted it over):

- finish boeing intern
- sats
- colleges; research and essay and all that
- boy scouts
- school prep
- Fall: school and college essays probably

1.
- applied to college (hopefully I got in)
- join swim team in spring
- summer: possibly look for an intern opportunity
- college?

2. 
- go to college
- probably join clubs at the college not rlly sure which ones yet
- meet new people
- college life
- look for opportunities and reach out to people

3-4)
- summer hopefully i am doing something productive. I hope to get a good internship and get a better feel for the work environment of my future job possibilities
- go back to college
- continue learning new things in college and take the necessary classes

5
- hopefully finishing up my degree and enjoy what I am doing (who knows) and then hopefully look for a job

Pretty standard stuff. Overall I guess I'm somewhat on track. Did most of what was on my list, but my 5-year plan started getting very vague near years 3-5 as tbh as I didn't know what I wanted as a high school kid. 

## 2025-2029 5-year plan
It's time to make another 5-year plan. I know life is unpredictable, but these are my general goals I have in mind for the next 5 years.

**2025-EOY**  
Starting out with where I left off, my most recent next steps are to find a job, basically. Coding interview prep and applications until something lands. Studying SWE concepts on the side (check out catlieb.com/notes). Right now, my skills lie primarily in front-end development and Python, and the things you can do with Python. I hope to expand this toolbox. 

My desires and motivating factor for this goal are nothing grandiose. It is rooted in keeping up with my peers, and I guess the normal life trajectory everyone takes. I used to think that I didn't want a normal life. I wanted to be special and different, but honestly, doing that requires a lot of risk - risk that might be negative EV in the long run, which I am not capable of handling right now. I want to be independent, capable of supporting myself, and living life on my own terms.

**2026**  
But what is after the job milestone? Ultimately, I want to be with my girlfriend. We're currently long-distance (5k+ miles), and I haven't seen her for months now. My main goal this year would be to continue working towards building a future with her. My contract with my current job will end this year, so I may or may not be unemployed at this time if the job search does not go as planned.

I like to think about the worst-case scenario. What if the job search does not go as planned? If I do not have another job lined up by this time, I would be considering applying and going back to graduate school in a math-related field. Even though I don't want to go back to school right now, I need to keep moving forward in some way, right?

**2027**  
I would turn 24 years old in less than 2 years, which is scary to think about. Currently, in 2025, I feel like a lot can change about my life in many ways, and it is hard to predict where I will be in 2027. But, I guess this is how it was when I applied for colleges back in 2020 as well. I had NO IDEA where I would be in 2023-2024, hence the vagueness of my 5-year plan. At this point, I would hope to either work or pursue higher education and considering what's next. I hope to continue learning and improving every day. 

In the worst case scenario, I do not find a job and life does not go the way I want it to. Regardless, if anything, poker has toughened me to not be affected by these life downswings too much. It doesn't matter as well because if I know that I have put in the work-coding, improving, networking, I know that one day it will happen, it's just a matter of timing. I could have also taken the graduate school path, but I was told to hold off until I know exactly what I want to do, so who really knows? Ultimately, I need to be continually working towards the goals I have set myself.

**2028**  
In 2028, I would still be doing what I said in 2027. I would still be going to the gym or being active every day - eating healthy and keeping good relations with my friends. Going to church and maybe being in a church community. I honestly have no idea where I would be in 2028, which is crazy to think about. Perhaps I can pick up my old hobbies at this time. Am I living with my girlfriend now? I have no idea, man.

**2029**  
I've probably changed a lot by now. I would be 26 this year, and hopefully, I would have found stability in my career and relationships by now. Regardless of what happens over the next 5 years, I will not regret who I become. If I continue to journal, perhaps I can see how I have changed these past few years. I've added back some old catlieb.com strips that I removed before (actually nvm too cringe sry). It's really hard to say what will come up in life within these 5 years. As the year gets further away, my goals are less concrete. 

## One Piece
I started watching One Piece - an episode or two a day. The show has over 1,000 episodes, and it's a grind. But in a way, starting the show is kinda like where I am at right now. 1,000 feels like a lot, but a little a day makes a difference in the long run. Not thinking about how big the obstacle is, but instead working bit by bit towards your goal each day and enjoying the process. Thanks for reading!

There is no conclusion
