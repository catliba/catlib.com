## Life Update
It has been a while since I have decided to write something here. So much has changed about my life since my last strip, I don't even know where to begin. For one, I have officially graduated from undergrad - bye bye SD. Wouldn't have changed much on how I spent my 4 years at undergrad. Secondly, I feel like my hobbies previously have all changed. I remember I used to play video games, play chess, and watch anime. Now, those things don't interest me anymore unless done socially. Lastly, I am not unemployed, but work remotely as a full time math tutor. Work is chill, but I'm still actively looking for a job in something I'm more interested in and considering higher education. 

With two years of not practicing the art of journalism, I hope I still got it in me to write something of value.

## Time Consumption
The saying goes: "Time is money," and I agree. Time is money, but to quantify your life to how much money you make per hour is such a bleak way to live. Obviously, get a job, make money, support yourself and hopefully your family in the future. That is the path of life we all walk. But when I do what I love, time gets lost in between. I don't consider my time spent as a sacrifice, but rather an investment towards my future. 

## Interests 
What is it that I love though? Is it sustainable? Obviously if I love doomscrolling on Instagram reels, its over for me, I'm probably not going to get anywhere in life. But what about other hobbies? Coding is obviously a lucrative hobby to have, if I enjoy doing that, then I'll probably get paid doing it down the line. If I love math, that also is promising. If I love music, I see potential in my future as well. I'm not saying that I like or dislike any of the things I just listed, but perhaps some have started to grow on me with my old age.

## Poker
Now let me address the elephant in the room. The past year, I've been really into No Limit Texas Hold'em. Introduced by a friend from church, Dan, I became hooked to the game the more I played it. When I play the game, I lose track of time. Hours feel like minutes and sometimes, I forget to eat meals. Having played chess all my life, I like the feeling of winning against an opponent. In particular, knowing that your strategy is superior and better than theirs is oddly satisfying to me. Analyzing patterns, making tough calls with limited information, and being disciplined are some aspects of becoming a winning player. I've been studying the game and playing micro stakes .25/.5 ($50 buy ins) incessantly for the past year and the half, and have made upwards of $25,000.

## We’re… Back?
However, is poker sustainable? Many people in my life say no, and I'm not one to shrug off advice from the people that love me. That is why I plan on taking a healthy break from the game I so love playing. It's going to be hard, but I think I can do it this time. In the meantime, I'll focus on more pressing responsibilities and possibly exploring other hobbies. Wish me luck, and see you next time.
