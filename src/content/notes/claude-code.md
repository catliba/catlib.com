# Claude Code Tutorial

In this tutorial, I will go over the basics of Cluade Code. This is still currently a work in progress. To be continued.... but to get started, you need to buy a plan which I am too poor to buy at the moment so this tutorial is being put on hold.

`npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`

inside project folder, run
>`claude`
