# Preflop Ranges

Understanding basic preflop gives you the most edge on a table. Identifying fish in a game usually involves seeing what their preflop raising range and VPIP is and if it deviates from the standard. 

6 handed play. Play a little tighter 9 handed.

#### When to 3! vs RFI

BB play is not listed as it is bit more complex. Everything below is a 3!, we are not cold calling anything. Suited connectors *very* infrequent raises if even at all.

<div style="margin-left: 1rem;">

<details>
<summary><strong>vs UTG RFI</strong></summary>

<div style="margin-left: 1rem;">

Note: in a 9 handed game, UTG would be around UTG2~LJ. The tightest you will ever want to 3!, as early position (EP) players play a strong range.
- as the HJ : 99+, A9s+, A5s–A4s, KTs+, QJs, AQo+
    - suited connectors (45, 56, 67) very infrequent 3!
    - super tight, notice how we don't play JTs, QTs, KQo
- as the CO : same tightness as HJ
    - suited connectors (45, 56, 67) very infrequent 3!
    - add in KQo, QTs, 88 occasionally 
- as the BTN : 88+, A9s+, A5s–A4s, KTs+, QJs+, AQo+
    - Loosest position (discounting BB) but still very tight
    - Every single suited broadway or offsuit Q and higher
    - suited connectors (56, 67) very infrequent 3!
- as the SB : 99+, ATs+, A5s, KTs+, QTs+, AKo
    - rather tight
    - AQo occasionally

</div>

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>vs HJ RFI</strong></summary>

<div style="margin-left: 1rem;">

Notice that we are loosening up, but still playing only top of range (suited broadways mainly)
- as the CO : 88+, A9s+, A5s-A4s, KTs+, QTs+, JTs, AJo+, KQo
    - suited connectors (45, 56, 67) very infrequent 3! (25%)
    - Mainly just suited broadway hands
- as the BU : same as HJ
    - suited connectors (45, 56, 67) very infrequent 3!
    - add in T9, 77 occasionally 
- as the SB : 99+, ATs+, A5s, KTs+, QTs+, AKo
    - tightest configuration, no 9 suited hands and no AJo or KQo
    - 88 and A4s 50% freq
    - suited broadways and AQo+ essentially

</div>

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>vs CO RFI</strong></summary>

<div style="margin-left: 1rem;">

We see a noticeable difference in opening ranges facing when the CO RFI compared to when EP RFI. Can be more liberal with raises.
- as the BU : 66+, A8s+, A3s-A5s, K9s+, QTs+, J9s+, T9s, AJo+, KQo
    - occasionally (borderline) mix in A7s, ATo, KJo, Q9s
    - still no KTo, QTo, QJo
    - 45s, 56s, 67s are infrequent raises
- as the SB : 88+, A9s+, A5s, KTs+, QTs+, AQo, KQo
    - occasionally raise with 77, A4s, K9s, J9s (note J9 is selected as a raise and not Q9s because J9s is a suited gapper), AJo
