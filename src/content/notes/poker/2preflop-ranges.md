# Preflop Ranges

Understanding basic preflop gives you the most edge on a table. Identifying fish in a game usually involves seeing what their preflop raising range and VPIP and PFR is and if it deviates from the standard. 

6 handed play. Play a little tighter 9 handed.


#### First to raise (RFI)

#### When to 3! vs RFI

BB play is not listed as it is bit more complex. Everything below is a 3!, we are not cold calling anything. Suited connectors *very* infrequent raises if even at all.

<div style="margin-left: 1rem;">

<details>
<summary><strong>vs UTG RFI</strong></summary>

<div style="margin-left: 1rem;">

Note: in a 9 handed game, UTG would be around UTG2~LJ. The tightest you will ever want to 3!, as early position (EP) players play a strong range.
- as the HJ : 99+, A9s+, A5s–A4s, KTs+, QJs, AQo+
    - suited connectors (45, 56, 67) very infrequent 3!
    - super tight, notice how we don't play JTs, QTs, KQo
- as the CO : same tightness as HJ
    - suited connectors (45, 56, 67) very infrequent 3!
    - add in KQo, QTs, 88 occasionally 
- as the BTN : 88+, A9s+, A5s–A4s, KTs+, QJs+, AQo+
    - Loosest position (discounting BB) but still very tight
    - Every single suited broadway or offsuit Q and higher
    - suited connectors (56, 67) very infrequent 3!
- as the SB : 99+, ATs+, A5s, KTs+, QTs+, AKo
    - rather tight
    - AQo occasionally

</div>

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>vs HJ RFI</strong></summary>

<div style="margin-left: 1rem;">

Notice that we are loosening up, but still playing only top of range (suited broadways mainly)
- as the CO : 88+, A9s+, A5s-A4s, KTs+, QTs+, JTs, AJo+, KQo
    - suited connectors (45, 56, 67) very infrequent 3! (25%)
    - Mainly just suited broadway hands
- as the BU : same as HJ
    - suited connectors (45, 56, 67) very infrequent 3!
    - add in T9, 77 occasionally 
- as the SB : 99+, ATs+, A5s, KTs+, QTs+, AKo
    - tightest configuration, no 9 suited hands and no AJo or KQo
    - 88 and A4s 50% freq
    - suited broadways and AQo+ essentially

</div>

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>vs CO RFI</strong></summary>

<div style="margin-left: 1rem;">

- as the BU : 66+, A8s+, A3s-A5s, K9s+, QTs+, J9s+, T9s, AJo+, KQo
    - occasionally (borderline) mix in A7s, ATo, KJo, Q9s
    - still no KTo, QTo, QJo
    - 45s, 56s, 67s are infrequent raises
- as the SB : 88+, A9s+, A5s, KTs+, QTs+, AQo, KQo
    - occasionally raise with 77, A4s, K9s, J9s (note J9 is selected as a raise and not Q9s because J9s is a suited gapper), AJo

Still tighter than what many would actually play in my opinion. We are folding suited connectors at a 75% frequency here and just including some X9 suited hands in our range.

</div>

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>vs BTN RFI</strong></summary>

<div style="margin-left: 1rem;">

- as the SB : 55+, A4s+, K9s+, Q9s+, J9s+, T8s+, AJo+, KJo+

</div>

</details>

#### BB vs RFI

Exclusively analysing the big blind position facing raises from all the other positions as this is the only time we are cold calling raises.

<div style="margin-left: 1rem;">

<details>
<summary><strong>BB vs UTG RFI</strong></summary>

<div style="margin-left: 1rem;">

For Call, the more left, the more often we call a bigger BB RFI (3-4bb) and the more right the less we would want to involve ourselves with a larger RFI.
For Mix, the more left, the more often you would want to 3! rather than call.
- **3!**: QQ+, AK, KQs+
- **Call** Pure: 22-JJ, A9s-A6s, K9s-K2s, Q9s-Q2s, J8s-J5s, Suited Gappers (T8s, 97s, 86s, 75s...), Suited Two-Gappers (T7s, 96s, 85s), Offsuit Broadway hands
- **Mix** between Call and 3!: Suited Broadways (AQs, QJs, KTs, QTs, JTs), A5s-A2s, Suited Connectors (..., 87s, 76s, 65s, 54s)

Notice the heavy preference towards suited hands vs offsuit.  
The lower the suited hand quality, the less we want to be involved (74s, 62s, 43s, 52s).    
Interestingly enough, hands like KQs and KJs really enjoy a high frequency 3! even more so than AQs probably because AQs is a very good hand and we don't want to get 4! with it. 

</div>

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>BB vs HJ RFI</strong></summary>

<div style="margin-left: 1rem;">

- **3!**: JJ+, AQs+, KJs+, QTs+, JTs, AKo
- **Call**: 22-TT, AJs-A6s, Offsuit Broadways (AQo, KQo, etc), K9s-K2s, Suited Gappers, Suited Two-Gappers, T6s, 95s, 84s, A9o, A5o
- **Mix** between Call and 3: A5s-A2s, Suited Connectors

QTs, JTs can occasionally call instead of 3!, but lean towards aggression.  
Hands not listed on the border between Call and 3! should be considered a mix (KTs).  
Much more frequent 3! range as the RFI position gets later and later. This is a common trend.

</div>

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>BB vs CO RFI</strong></summary>

<div style="margin-left: 1rem;">

Very similar to HJ, we are just widening our range a slight bit. (3! with TT+, more often 3! with suited connectors, offsuit high suited connectors calls, and overall wider 3! range like with Jx suited connectors or gappers).

</div>

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>BB vs BTN RFI</strong></summary>

<div style="margin-left: 1rem;">

- **3!**: 99+, Suited Broadways, A5s
- **Call**: Everything else listed above is still a call, any AXo, K6o+, J2s+, T2s+ 
- **Mix** between Call and 3: Suited connectors, JX suited gappers, A4s-A2s, AQo

Very wide range, much wider than what most people think. 

</div>

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>BB vs SB RFI</strong></summary>

<div style="margin-left: 1rem;">

Much more different than the other configrations.

- **3!**: TT+, ATs+, KTs+, AQo+
- **Call**: A9s-A6s, K9s-K2s, QJs-Q2s, offsuit broadways, suited gappers, suited two gappers and many suited trash
- **Mix** between Call and 3: Suited connectors, J7s-J2s, T6s-T2s, A7o-A2po K9o-K6o, Q9o, Q8o, J9o, J8o

In BvB, we want to be more polarized. Calling with our pretty good hands.

</div>

</details>

#### We RFI and face a 3!

Facing a 3!, our range severely narrows, folding out a lot of our weak suited aces and calling with hands that are considered in in the middle of our range. Moreso if we raised early position. Some common leaks in players include calling too much against 3!'s and under 4! too much.

<div style="margin-left: 1rem;">
<details>
<summary><strong>as UTG RFI facing a 3!...</strong></summary>

<div style="margin-left: 1rem;">

- vs HJ/CO 3!: 
    - **4!**: KK+ and AKs pure. 
    - **4!/Call (75/25)**: QQ, AQo+ (AQo fold 25% instead of call), KJs+. 
    - **4!/Call (50/50)**: A5s, KTs, JJ, AJs, ATs. 
    - **Pure call** AQs, TT (probably because these hands are good so we don't want to get 5!). 
    - **Call/Fold** pocket pairs (66-88) and suited connectors leaning towards fold.
        - Note that a hand like 99 isn't including anywhere but it lies in between Pure call and Call. I'll let readers decide what they want to do here. 
    - **Fold** everything else like any suited ace besides A5s, KQo, AJo, QTs, any X9s hand.
- vs BTN 3!: Very similar to above
    - more calls like QJ, QTs, JTs, A4s where **mix** between call and fold 5050. 
    - AJo still **folding** along with KQo and worse
- vs BU 3!: Widen our calling range even more. Calling more with lower pocket pairs and such.
- vs SB/BB 3!: Tightest. 
    - We are only **4!** KK+, AKs pure.
    - **Call** with AKo, QQ, and other suited broadway hands. 
    - Very rarely can we try a 4! with A5s. 
    - We are **folding** offsuit hands including AQo unless a low frequency bluff like with A5s.     

Wow. Poker really isn't fun when you're playing it right. Look how tight we have to be when facing a 3! as EP. Literally just suited broadways and not even that (QJ, QT call/fold EPvsMP) Reminder not to overcall with suited connectors and pocket pairs as those fold at a 50% frequency or higher most of the times. 

</div>

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>as the HJ RFI facing a 3!...</strong></summary>

<div style="margin-left: 1rem;">

- vs CO 3!:
    - **4!**: QQ+, AKs, KJs, KTs, AQo+
        - KJs, KTs, AQo is more of a bluff 4!
    - **Mix between 4! and call**: JJ, ATs, AJs, A5s, KQs
    - **Call/Fold**: Pocket pairs 33+, suited connectors (75% fold)
- vs BU 3!:
    - **4!**: more pure QQ+, AK, AQo
    - **Mix between 4! and call**: JJ, TT (25% 4!), ATs, KJs-K9s (K9s callfold 5050), A5s-A4s
    - **Call**: A9s, AJs, AQs, KQs, QJs, JTs, 77+
    - **Call/Fold**: suited conntectors and low pocket pairs
- vs SB/BB 3!: Much less 4! and more calling.
    - **4!**: only the best pure AA KK AKs
    - **Call**: Pretty much everything else with the last calling threshold being at X9 suited hands folding and KQo and AJo hands leaning towards *folding*.

</div>

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong> as the CO RFI facing a 3!...</strong></summary>

<div style="margin-left: 1rem;">

- vs BTN 3!:
    - **4! 75% or higher**: JJ+, AQo
    - **4!/Call**: AJo (fold 50%), A5s-A4s, KJs-K9s, QJs-QTs
    - **Call**: AQs-A8s, KQs, 22-TT, J9s
    - **Fold**: KQo (occasionally call or raise), offsuit broadways, K8s and worse, Q9s and worse, J8s and worse
- vs SB/BB 3!:
    - **4! 75% or higher**: KK+, AKs,  
    - **4!/Call**: AJo+, JJ+, K5s, A4s
    - **Call**: Suited broadways, A5s
    - **Fold**: KQo (occasionally call or raise)

Follows mostly a linear 4! pattern. We typically call those suited hands more than 4! but go aggressive with your offsuit broadways. Call much more against the SB.

</div>

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>as the BTN RFI facing a 3!...</strong></summary>

<div style="margin-left: 1rem;">

- vs SB/BB 3!:
    - **4! 75% or higher**: QQ+
    - **4!/Call**: JJ, AJo, K5s, Q9s, AQo, ATo, A2s, A3s, A6s, A7s, J8s, T8s
    - **Call**: 66+, higher suited connectors, KQs-K9s, QJs-QTs
    - **Fold**: KXs non broadway call 50%, 22-44 and low suited connectors call low freq

Notice how polar the 4! range is against the blinds. Don't get bullied by them!

</div>

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>as the SB RFI facing a 3! from the BB</strong></summary>

<div style="margin-left: 1rem;">

- **4!** pure: TT+, AQs+,
- **4!/Call**: ATo+, KJo+, A5s-A2s, K7s-K5s
- **Call**: 22+, A2s+, K5s+, X8s+ hands, suited connectors call pure

</div>

</details>

#### Facing a 4!

Ask yourself if villian is 4! bluffing optimally. If no they are not and only 4! with the best hands, then you often don't need to call many hands and just fold. In general though, here is the optimal strategy against a 4!. They are relatively the same across all configurations:

- **5!**:  KK+, AK, sometimes QQ depending on positional arragement
- **Call**: AJs+, KJs+, TT-QQ, suited connectors 25%
- Fold everything else

#### Cold 4! vs a RFI and 3!

Very very tight range overall, especially early position. 

- 4! vs UTG RFI and HJ 3!
    - QQ+, AQs+, AKo
    - KQs, A5s 50% frequency
- 4! vs HJ RFI and CO 3!
    - QQ+, AQs+, KQs, AKo
    - JJ, KJs, A5s 50% freq
    - AQo very rarely
- 4! vs CO RFI and BTN 3!
    - JJ+, AJs+, KJs+
    - AQo 75%
    - no A5s
- 4! vs BTN 
    - TT+, ATs+, KTs+, AQo


#### Squeeze Range

When someone opens and a cold caller. The more people that come into a hand, the tighter you play.

- BTN/SB Squeeze Range
    - 3! ONLY: 88+, suited broadways, AJo+
    - 3! occasionally: A5s, KQo, T9s, suited connectors rarely
- BB Squeeze Range
    - Refer to BB vs RFI and slightly tighten the outermost portions of our range
