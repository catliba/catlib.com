##### What makes a winning player?
I wanted to jot down my notes and experience playing No Limit Texas Hold'em. In these notes, I'm going to assume knowledge of basic rules of the game as well as player position. I'll be sharing more so strategy and GTO knowledge.

First and foremost, if you want to win at this game, the most important thing even before sitting at the table is game selection. We want to be able to identify a table with players that are significantly softer than average. If there is no one obviously losing a lot of money, it's probably not a good game and YOU SHOULD GET OUTTA THERE.

Also, managing your emotions is the next most important thing in becoming a winning player. How is your game during a downswing? How do you feel about losing 50 buy-ins? Kings into aces 10 times in a row? On the flipside, what about when you're running good? Do you play looser, call more often, feel more entitled? Stick to a solid strategy and don't let emotion cloud your judgement. Don't take your past hands with that much weight. Emotional management requires your own self awareness and willingness to reflect.

Lastly, assuming all else is equal (soft and emotionally aware), skill and understanding the game is the final differentiating factor, which is what I will be documenting here in my notes.

DO NOT BE RESULTS ORIENTED.
##### Pick your own win-rate
Nothing in life is certain except death, taxes, and rake. A typical 200NL game rakes ~5bb/player. This means that after 100 hands, 30bb is being taken off the table. Now, ask yourself, "Who is losing 30bb per 100 hands?" This is why poker, while it is a skill game, it is more so a game of identifying bad players and taking their money. Studying does give you an edge yes, but not a 30bb/100hand edge. That's just unrealistic. Search for tables with high VPIP and low PFR stats.

##### Active and Passive Errors
Active errors are mistakes that involve you putting money in the pot such as betting raising and calling. Being too aggressive or too station-y are examples of active errors. In addition, continuation betting too often or over-bluffing the river are more specific examples of active errors.

Passive errors are mistakes caused by doing nothing too often. This includes overfolding and over checking or missing value and bluffs. Not continuation betting enough or under-bluffing the river are some specific examples.

Humans are naturally risk adverse. No one wants to lose hundreds to thousands of dollars. This is why you should try go for it more often and make more active errors than passive errors. Making an active error can lead to folds since the opponent can make a passive error. We want to force our opponents to do something. We want to hit the ball and put it in their court to see what they will do.

##### What does GTO entail?
"Playing GTO" means playing at Nash equilibrium. 

##### Vocab
**Voluntary Put in Pot (VPIP)**: The frequency at which a player plays a hand preflop by putting in some chips.
**BB**: Big blind, in a 200NL game, the blinds are 1/2 so 1bb is $2.
