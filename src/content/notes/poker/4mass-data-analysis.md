##### What is Mass Data Analysis (MDA)?
MDA is a gigantic database of hands processed to show us the most common and frequent leaks in humans playing poker. Most people make the same mistakes, normally distributed.  
Two distinctions: Regs and Fish. Regs want to play good poker and fish are here to gamble and not trying to be better.  
MDA looks at overfolded and underfolded spots as well as overbluffed and underbluffed spots in the game.  
Use MDA as a strong suggestion, know when to follow this data and make connections with theory. When to follow/deviate. Many spots where MDA and GTO agree, and there exists spots where they disagree. For instance, 3BP B-B-B line is overfolded and theory shows that because on a Q5272r runout, facing an all in, the player needs to find calls with 33, 54, 66, 77, 88, 99 which is hard to find. Thus, theory backs up the overfolded texture of this line.  
Studying MDA not only helps you exploit villians, but can also help you self examine your own leaks and flawed playstyle.

##### Bluff Catching Regs
5 things to look for when determining whether villian is bluffing.
- **Position**
    - later positions significantly overbluffed (BTN-BB)
    - CO is neutral
    - EP-MP underbluffed
- **Board Texture**
    - lower disconnected boards overbluffed
    - 4 Flush River significantly overbluffed in all discontinued lines and underbluffed in continued lines
    - triple broadway, 4 flush turn, monotone, and A high boards are underbluffed
    - everything else neutral
- **Line**
    - discontinued overbluffed
    - continued underbluffed
- **Flop Bet Size**
    - larger less likely bluffing
    - 0-33% overbluffed (including a X)
    - 75%+ underbluffed
- **River Bet Size**
    - 50% and lower is overbluffed
    - 90%+ is underbluffed
