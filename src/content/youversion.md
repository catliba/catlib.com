## YouVersion
I have an interview with YouVersion tomorrow and I wanted to write down my thoughts to prepare for it. As catlieb.com is currently undergoing a revival process, why don't I kill two birds with one stone? 

YouVersion is the company that developed the Bible app. With roughly a billion installs worldwide, any Christian that owns a smart device probably has this app on their phone. The YouVersion interview process started out like any other, with a phone interview talking about my experiences. Then they gave me an online frontend development assessment and later on asked me to walk through it in a call. Tomorrow, I have another interview.

What I know so far about the interview is that it is going to be more behavioral: "Our engineers didn't get to cover all the questions they wanted from your last interview, so we're taking a step of care by walking through our church's culture and how it impacts the Engineering Team, while asking for examples of these culture points in your own life."

I believe that the interview tomorrow will not only ask me about my projects and what I've built, but go deeper in asking who I am and why I build. I don't think this deeply when coding, so I plan on fleshing out my experiences with God throughout my life and how that relates to what I want to do with my life in the future.  What I'm applying to SWE roles in the first place, etc.

## My Walk with God
I was going to church as young as I can remember. My mom always took me and my sister on Sundays and Friday nights. We would play and get along with the church kids there and I've always felt that church was just another part of my life. I've had my school friends, and then I would have my church friends. I learned stories about Jesus, Noah's Ark, and Adam and Eve. I would play worship games. I would sing worship songs. As a kid, I didn't think too much about going to church as it was always a normal part of my life. 

Around the age of 5, we moved places, and consequently found a new church. This would be the church I grew up in most of my life. Friday nights and Sundays, I would meet the same group of kids. One key thing I want to note during this time of my life was that I was an incredibly shy kid. I've gotten better now, but back then, if I arrived late to Friday night worship, I would be too scared to go down and join the kids' group and instead stay with my mom upstairs for the rest of the night. I was afraid to talk to older kids and I constantly shied away from any interaction besides with my one or two friends. I guess I was a really quiet kid, too scared to talk to mostly everyone and just there because I came with my parents. Regardless, I really liked the woman who led the kids' group every Friday night. Her lectures/stories(? idk what they're called) captivated me, and those nights were really special even looking back right now. Her gospel stories were thought provoking and the games afterwards were fun. I would definitely say the ministry was at its peak during these years. At this time, there were many kids of all ages K-12, and I was in elementary school (K-5). When Reni left, my attendance to church on Friday nights dwindled. I was never really that good of friends with many people at the church, so not going didn't bother me personally. My sister had more friends, and sometimes, I would tag along. However, as I got older (high school), my responsibilities piled up and my mom became less strict about going to church on Sundays as well Church attendance was at an all time low during this time, and it stayed that way all throughout COVID. 

## Church and college
With COVID coming to an end, I found myself at college with no friends and felt super lonely. Being cooped up in my room during COVID, I got too comfortable not talking to anyone new face to face for a year or two (Zoom doesn't count). Socially awkward and lost in college, my first two weeks of college were quite rough. The change from living at home to at college was very hard on me, and I was severely homesick. I remember a conversation with an older girl at a Korean church I was visiting on my second or third week of undergrad. She has been at the church for years now and I was telling her how homesick I was and that I missed my parents and everything at home. She told me that she felt the same way back then and that the feeling fades. I forgot who she was, but I vividly remember that conversation like it was yesterday. Scary how time flies in a blink of an eye, and crazy how much I've changed. Anyways, I visited some other churches and eventually, I found Lighthouse Bible Church (LBC). I started going there for the rest of my time in college. 

## The LBC Community
The LBC college ministry was a huge group. Without my mom urging me to go anymore, my attendance to church on Fridays and Sundays were sporadic. Sometimes on Fridays, I would be too scared to meet people and just not go. When I did go, I would have a hard time talking to anyone. For the first year or so, I felt like an outsider, just standing or sitting there every Friday and Sunday after sermon, looking stupid. I was still that shy kid back then, too scared to talk to other people - nothing about me has changed. Eventually though, I found my friends there and still talk to many of them today! Since LBC, I've gained the confidence to connect normally with other people at church.

I recall my first car ride to a KBBQ with some other kids my grade at LBC. They asked me if I was saved. I didn't understand the question at the time. The dude in the car said if I was comfortable dying then and there in a car accident, secure in my faith that I would go to heaven. I was very confused. I never had that many thoughts about my faith; I've always just assumed that I was Christian. Looking back now, I was being grilled pretty hard; I'm not sure why – it was pretty intense. Sometimes I wonder if these guys are more Christian than I am; they're devout in their Bible readings, they go to church every Sunday, and they just seem like they belong there on Friday and Sunday nights. I am not like them. I tell myself that I want to read the Bible but I never consistently do. I'm too scared to go to church by myself, and I've started to pray less and less. 

## My future with Christ
So, what now? I guess I can say that I'm going through a period of spiritual dryness. Obviously I could be going to the nearby church by myself. I could be reading the Bible everyday. I could be doing all these things, but I'm not. Why? Is it because I'm not Christian anymore? 

I wouldn't say that. I'm still convicted to follow Christ, but I don't know why I take no action. I'm scared to drive to church every Sunday. Is it my pride preventing me from going? Telling people that I live with my parents at home, I feel like a man child. I haven't grown up whatsoever. I believe that moving out of my hometown would help me rekindle my fire and rejoin a church community. 

## Conclusion
Working at YouVersion will probably be very different from a traditional workplace. I would assume that the people are more Christ-focused, and I feel like we would be more connected by that than at any other job. That is why I expect the interview process to be a bit different, as I am being exposed to Christ-related questions that have come up throughout the interview. This fits well with me though.

## Interview Prep
If I do not have a strong opinion on something, say this:
“Oh I would want to look into Scripture more for a more informed answer, but I think my initial thought is …[insert opinion]... but I would have to look into it more.”

How do you carry out God in your everyday work and projects?
First of all, I remember my pastor saying that we should be thankful for work, and that it is literally built into us as humans to do work. As it is to eat and relax. 
You should work as if you are working for God, not for men. This means doing your job with diligence and integrity, knowing that from the Lord you will receive your reward.
Work as service: The Apostle Paul instructed followers to work "heartily, as for the Lord and not for men" (Colossians 3:23).
 Because Christians are ultimately working for God, they are motivated to perform their tasks with excellence and high ethical standards, even when no one is watching.
As a Christian, all the work that I do, I do for God. I don’t work for anybody else. When I sit down and create a project, I honestly don’t think too hard about it but I do believe that at the end of the day, what we do in our work should serve and glorify God and anything that does the opposite is work that shouldn’t be done.

I’ve always been drawn to the mathematical and strategic side of poker — the probability theory, decision-making under uncertainty, and game dynamics. That’s what I’ve focused on in my writing and projects. But I’m also aware that gambling can be a temptation or struggle for some people, and I try to be careful about where I draw that line. For me, it’s not about chasing luck or money — it’s about understanding systems and human behavior. Still, I’m mindful about not letting that interest cross into something that could take me away from God or good stewardship.
