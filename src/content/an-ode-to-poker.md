## A lucky break
I've been taking a break from poker, and, to be frank, I feel like my life has improved significantly. I realize that my mentality to the game was unhealthy; I had to be up on the day, otherwise, I constantly think about winning it back. This led to an unhealthy attachment to variance and a constant need to “prove” myself through short-term results. Now, I’m more present, less anxious, and I feel like I’ve regained control over my time and energy. 

## This game sucks
When played right, poker is boring. The game quite literally tests your patience unless you wanna burn money. This is bad because I realize how valuable my time is right now and that it shouldn't be spent sitting hours on end waiting for pocket aces only to lose with it  (exaggeration btw im not a nit). The game really does suck the life out of you, and it is just one of the many reasons why I've stepped away from it.

## Sickening
Disicipline is something I've learned poker too - detaching yourself from mindless greed and a sense of entitlement. You learn to take losses and move forward without too much of the in between. In other words, you become an emotionless, masochistic robot. You get nervous over 10%, and your human emotions begin to neutralize. Rare, yes, but never, ever count it out.You feel sick to your stomach. You question where you went wrong in life. You doubt everyone, and then you start thinking that lying to your friends is okay (sorry Jisung). Every frequentist becomes Bayesian after enough iterations.

## Yeah fuck this game
Stepping away gives me clarity on my life, something that might've been lost at some point of time while playing this game. While I do dabble still from time to time, I am much more healthier at taking losses and treat it moreso as a hobby, not something that dictates my mood. My tilt control has also improved drastically, and I see it while playing real time. I don't feel the dying need to win back my money, and I'm able to move on with my life. Patience, discipline, tilt control, strong mental, assessing EV decisions under pressure, strategic thinking and adaptability - poker is good when treating it as a mental gym rather than a financial addiction, and like with gym, the hardest part is walking through the door.

## Poker Community
The community is what I miss the most tbh. I miss talking to the people, sharing hand histories, and just talking with my friends about the game. Leaving this game felt like I lost some friends, but ig that's just life.
