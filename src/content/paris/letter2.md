Dear Weiwei,

I miss you a lot. I feel like you are the only person right now that I can really by myself around and just not have to worry or think about anything else. Without you, I would feel so lonely. Our long talks over facetime really helps me push through each day and you take away my worries, even if it is for a brief moment. This long distance relationship really sucks, and I hope we will be together soon.
