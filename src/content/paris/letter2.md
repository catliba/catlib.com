Dear Weiwei,

I miss you a lot. I feel like you are the only person right now that I can really be myself around and just not have to worry or think about anything else. I can talk about whatever, say whatever without double thinking about it, and just open up myself with you. Seriously, there is no one else that I can do that with. Without you I feel so lonely living my life. Our long talks over facetime really helps me push through each day and you take away my worries, even if it is for a brief moment. This long distance relationship really sucks, and I hope we will be together soon.
