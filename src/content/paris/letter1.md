# TO WEIWEI:

 <span style="font-size: 1.2em;">

Herro weiwei. I guess this is one of many letters you will be receiving during our time apart. I don't know what to write —I've written like 2 drafts now—but I gotta write something, right? Otherwise, you would be MIFFY, and no one likes being MIFFY. If you haven't noticed already, unlike the physical letter I gave to you, this one is much less serious because you will be getting many more letters to come, and they can't all be serious, right?

Anyway, I hope you are doing well in China. Actually, I know you are because we call every day, but I hope you continue doing well. Because I am Libby, and that is what Libby wants. Only the best for WEIWEI. I see how hardworking you are in China every day when we call, and that makes me guilty if I ever waste my days doing nothing or playing poker (which I have officially cut out of my life for the time being btw). You motivate me to keep pushing and not lose sight of my goals, and I just want to say thank you for everything. Even during our time apart, you guide me towards the right direction, and I can feel that you care so much for me. I am eternally grateful for having you in my life, something this silly letter cannot fathom into words.

I was gonna make this letter longer, but quality over quantity right? You will be getting many letters in the future so don't worry. Libby always keeps his word!

Your loving boyfriend,  
Libby
