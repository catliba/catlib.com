## Prologue
In this strip, I'm going to share an aspect of my personal life that I've been wanting to share - my upbringing with Christianity. Never really wrote it down but I owe it to myself to just reflect on my past for what it was so that I can live more intentionally in the present and grow in a way that’s edifying to the Lord. It also gives my church friends who care to read this a better glimpse into my faith and how I grew up with God.

## Genesis of Catlib
I was going to church as young as I can remember. My mom always took me and my sister to church on Sundays and Friday nights. We would play and get along with the kids there and I've always felt that church was just another part of my life. I've had my school friends, and then I would have my church friends. I learned stories about Jesus, Noah's Ark, and Adam and Eve. I would play worship games, sing worship songs, and go to VBS.

Around the age of 5, we moved places, and consequently found a new church. This would be the church I grew up in most of my life. Friday nights and Sundays, I would meet the same group of kids. One key thing during this time of my life was that I was an incredibly shy kid. I've gotten better now, but back then, if I arrived late to Friday night worship, I would be too scared to go down and join the kids' group. Instead, I would stay with my mom upstairs for the rest of the night. I was afraid to talk to older kids and I constantly shied away from any interaction besides with my one or two friends. I guess I was a really quiet kid - too scared to talk like a normal human being. Regardless, I really liked the woman who led the kids' group every Friday night (her name was Reni). Her lectures & stories captivated me, and those nights were really special even looking back right now. Her gospel stories were thought provoking and the games we would play afterwards were fun. I would definitely say the ministry at my church was at its peak during these years. There were many kids of all ages K-12, and I was in elementary school during this period. Unfortunately, during middle school, one of my closest church friends at the time moved out of California. In addition to that, Reni moved as well, and my attendance to church on Friday nights dwindled. I still had one other friend at church so I would still go from time to time, but as a kid, I never really thought too deeply about the real reason why we are going to church. I would just ask if my one other friend, Nathan, was going and if he wasn't I would try and squeamish my way out of going. Nevertheless, I would go when my mom and sister went, and we went pretty frequently. However, as I got older (high school), my responsibilities piled up and my mom became less strict about going to church on Sundays as well. Church attendance was at an all time low during this time, and it stayed that way all throughout COVID. 

## The bird leaves the nest
With COVID coming to an end, I found myself at college suddenly. After spending years cooped up in my room, I had grown too comfortable living behind a screen, rarely talking to anyone face to face. Socially awkward and unsure of myself, my first two weeks of college were quite rough.

I still remember visiting a Korean church during my second or third week of undergrad (I went mainly because of the free KBBQ). There, I met an older student who had been at UCSD for a while. I was telling her how homesick I was and that I missed my parents and everything at home. She told me that she felt the same way back then and that the feeling fades. I forgot who she was, but I vividly remember that conversation like it was yesterday. Scary how time flies in a blink of an eye, and crazy how much I've changed. Anyways, I visited some other churches and eventually, I found Lighthouse Bible Church (LBC). I started going there for the rest of my time in college. 

## The LBC Community
The LBC college ministry was a huge group. Without my mom urging me to go anymore, my attendance to church on Fridays and Sundays were sporadic. Sometimes on Fridays, I would be too scared to meet people and just not go. When I did go, I would have a hard time talking to anyone. For the first year or so, I felt like an outsider, just standing or sitting there stupidly every Friday and Sunday after sermon. Guess I was still that shy kid back then, too scared to talk to other people. Eventually though, I found my friends there and still talk to many of them today! Since LBC, I've gained the confidence to connect normally with other people at church.

I recall my first car ride to an AYCE restrurant with some other kids my grade at LBC. They asked me if I was saved. I didn't understand the question at the time. The dude in the car said if I was comfortable dying then and there in a car accident, secure in my faith that I would go to heaven. I was very confused. I never had that many thoughts about my faith; I've always just assumed that I was Christian. Looking back now, I was being grilled pretty hard. I'm not sure why, but it was pretty intense. Going to Lighthouse taught me to become more intentional with my faith.

## Revalations about my life
So, what now? I guess I can say that I'm going through a period of spiritual dryness. Community is an important aspect of being a Christian because faith isn’t meant to be lived out alone. It’s through others — through shared struggles, encouragement, and accountability — that our beliefs take root and grow stronger. I realize this, yet I find it really difficult to drive to church by myself and integrate myself within a community. But why?

I'm convicted to follow Christ, yet I can't bring myself to go to church every Sunday. Is it because I fear being judged by other people? Still feeling like that shy kid with his mom on Friday nights, I feel overwhelmed by the people. Sometimes I think it’s my pride and shame that hold me back. When I go, I find myself telling people that I live with my parents. Silly as it may sound, but my pride is hurt, which kind of discourages me from going. 

I know comparison is the thief of joy, but it’s hard not to look around and feel behind after just graduating college. Still, I believe that change — maybe moving somewhere new, building fresh habits, and rejoining a church community — could help me rekindle that fire to integrate myself within a church commuinity.

## Conclusion
Thank you if you've read the far. Obviously, this is a very personal strip. Am I comfortable sharing this to the world wide web? I not even sure about that myself. But I believe that only my close friends would care enough to read all this so yeah. I know I still have a lot to work on spiritually, but I trust that with time, prayer, and faith, I can grow into who God calls me to be.

## Interview Prep
If I do not have a strong opinion on something, say this:
“Oh I would want to look into Scripture more for a more informed answer, but I think my initial thought is …[insert opinion]... but I would have to look into it more.”

How do you carry out God in your everyday work and projects?
First of all, I remember my pastor saying that we should be thankful for work, and that it is literally built into us as humans to do work. As it is to eat and relax. 
You should work as if you are working for God, not for men. This means doing your job with diligence and integrity, knowing that from the Lord you will receive your reward.
Work as service: The Apostle Paul instructed followers to work "heartily, as for the Lord and not for men" (Colossians 3:23).
 Because Christians are ultimately working for God, they are motivated to perform their tasks with excellence and high ethical standards, even when no one is watching.
As a Christian, all the work that I do, I do for God. I don’t work for anybody else. When I sit down and create a project, I honestly don’t think too hard about it but I do believe that at the end of the day, what we do in our work should serve and glorify God and anything that does the opposite is work that shouldn’t be done.

I’ve always been drawn to the mathematical and strategic side of poker — the probability theory, decision-making under uncertainty, and game dynamics. That’s what I’ve focused on in my writing and projects. But I’m also aware that gambling can be a temptation or struggle for some people, and I try to be careful about where I draw that line. For me, it’s not about chasing luck or money — it’s about understanding systems and human behavior. Still, I’m mindful about not letting that interest cross into something that could take me away from God or good stewardship.

Working at YouVersion will probably be very different from a traditional workplace. I would assume that the people are more Christ-focused, and I feel like we would be more connected by that than at any other job. That is why I expect the interview process to be a bit different, as I am being exposed to Christ-related questions that have come up throughout the interview. This fits well with me though.
